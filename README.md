# ONNX-RFFT

This repository contains all the programs and scripts needed to define an ONNX model that processes audio using the RFFT operation.
This is meant to be run in an environment like Google Colab but with suitable modifications can be run locally.
Each Python program and script is meant to go in its own cell in Colab.
Make sure to install the required ONNX libraries before running these.
Replace the path to your audio wherever required.
